  <h1>BRANDING</h1>
  <p>The first step in the project was creating the naming and designing a logo for the event site, followed by a colour palette combination.</p>
  <img src="Links/Im in_LOGO_01.jpg" class="Branding" alt="Branding"/>
  <p>The selected <span class="highlight">colour palette</span> is following both the accessibility principles of contrast between the background and the elements. It is also following current colour trends (pastel and fluor).</p>
  <p>On the other hand, all the elements are outlined in black. This helps to have them more contrasted with the rest of the elements, therefore more readable.</p>
  <img src="Links/Im in_LOGO_02.jpg" class="Branding" alt="Branding"/>
  <p>Also, I've designed some branding guidelines for the elements that will appear on all the website pages (the header and the footer, buttons, typography, icons, etc.). The guideline helps to settle the brand and helps users navigating through the website - creating a better user experience.</p>

    <p>The use of emojis as part of branding has a double purpose:</p>
    <p>First of all, to make the user recognize what they are talking about since I'm In is a web page with a big amount of information. As the Content Design London webpage says ​in its ​post ​"Readability Guidelines for Emojis: " They help express what you mean. Emojis are small, digital expressions that can be used to represent many things, including objects, people, actions, ideas. They can: support meaning, add feeling, and be fun to use."</p>
    <p>In this way, if there is a football ball, the user quickly knows that the event is about football.</p>
    <p>And on the other hand, emojis are a language that is well known by the target, so they help a brand-user connection. </p>
    <p>In summary, <span class="highlight"> emojis are a really appropriate solution to have a good user experience on our website.</span></p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The only issue we can face related to emojis it's about their copyright, which belongs to Apple Inc. It's important to think about this situation, but it has an easy solution: design our emojis following our branding guidelines. </p>

  <h1>MOCKUPS</h1>
  <p>The selected program to design the mockups has been Illustrator, due to it's a vectorial program, and it's possible to escalate the design as you wish, without losing quality on the graphics.</p>
  <p>Canvas size it's 1040px in width, and as much as needed of length. The canvas grid is divided into six columns of 145 px width and a span of 31px width in between, adding margins on both sides of 88px each.</p>
  <p>All pages start with the same header, where you can find the I'm In logo on the left, and on the right the sections "Home", "Events", "About" and "Basket" (marked with an icon of a shopping bag buys) sections.</p>
